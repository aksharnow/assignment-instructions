Hello,

I am a Frontend Trainer and I get a lot of assignments on daily basis to complete, I am kinda not finding time and looking to build a team who can help to deliver assignments on time, your payment will be taken care of immediately after the completion of assignment(Some times I will work along with you to complete them on time and you will be still paid for it), you can check my portfolio and my projects here http://www.belvikram.com

I will be paying in INR , Approx 1000 to 2000 per assignment depending amount of work needed.

To Make Assignments clean and finest quality of code we will follow below guidelines 


All the assignments come with 24hour deadline from the time of commitment, if there are additonal information needed, please let me know as soon as possible.

## General Guidelines

1. Each assignment will have instructions.md file which will tell you exactly what to do, if the instructions are not clear. we will talk and make it clear before you start the assignment, if the instructions.md is not provided you should get instructions from whatsApp or email, if you get instructions from whatsApp then add a file to your folder in your designated repository. Instructions are top most important than anything else, client will pay only if the instructions are met.
2. Every assignment should have readme.md
   1. Use the [template](https://github.com/aksharnow/assignment-instructions/blob/master/readme-template.md) and fill the details related to the assignment
   2. Please note that this template is frquently updated, use the up to date template available at the time of assignment.
3. if you are using boilerplate code remove all the code that is not related to the assignment
   1. if you are using create-react-app, remove the react logo, styles related to this logo, manifest.json file
   2. rename the title(browser' tab text) of the assignment in index.html to the title of the assignment
4. Always have separate css file for each component
   1. if you have header.js file then you should have header.css or header.scss file
   2. using of scss or less is preferable but if you are not familiar it is okay to use plain css
   3. always name your classNames with appropriate names likes
      1. header__title or header__logo etc
      2. Use Block-element-modifier style of naming the class names - it is super easy, try it out.

5. Please get yourself familiar with following technologies/libraries we will not use all of them but we will have lot of assignments have one or other combination of below
   1. javascript
   2. typescript
   3. css
   4. html
   5. JSX
   6. npm
   7. webpack
   8. babel
   9. React(class based and functional components)
   10. React hooks
   11. Redux
   12. Redux-thunk and redux-saga
   13. Mobx
   14. scss
   15. webpack
   16. Server side rendering
   17. block element modifier styles
   18. little knowledge on nodejs
   19. ES6 syntax
   20. Nextjs
6. Most importantly, ask all your question when you are assigned an assignment, since we are different time zones(India - USA - Brazil - Argentina  and Mexico)
 it will be waste of time to wait if you have questions in the middle of what you do. 
7. Making following assumptions on every assignment if until said
   1. Use API provided to get the data, if API is not provided and only mock data is provided, use services like www.myjson.com and get a fake API to complete the assignment.
   2. 50 % of the assignment will have designs, you need to match your assignments exactly to the designs provided but another 50% we do not get designs so we take liberty to do design how ever we like but it should look good, in that case use light colors than dark colors.
8. Always use ES6 syntax, but if the assignment says to use ES5 go with ES5.o

## Payments
1. As assignments are important to client payments are that important to our partners/employees, you will be paid for every assignment.

A WhatsApp group is created with you,me and person from accounts team, as soon as I am happy with the assignment you should receive payment immediately.


## Deadlines
1. Each Assignment comes with 24hours or deadline irrespective of the timeZone.
2. The way I promise the client is that every time deadline is missed the payment for the assignment is half the price of initial agreement

If I agree a assignment for a Client A for 2500 Rs and deadline is monday morning in indian time zone.

if delivered on Monday Morning: 
CLIENT A will pay me 2500 + Tips(if client likes the assignment)

if delivered on Tuesday Morning: 
CLIENT A will pay me 1250(since client is unhappy, it's rare to expect tips)

if delivered on Wednesday Morning: 
CLIENT A will pay me 625(We lost the client at this point)

if delivered on Thursday Morning: 
No Client to deliver :D

## Boiler plates
1. use [react-create-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Code Standards 

- Use single quotes on imports, 
- use double quotes on classNames and attributes
- Do not use !important on CSS
- Prefer a npm module as a depencency over adding script tag in html
- Add code comments where ever neccesary, not too many though.
- If a svg is used, put it in seperate file.
- No magic numbers, use constants and have constants file separetly



## How to deliver
1. I will create a github private repository and add you as collaborator, you should have full access to this repository.
2. Commit as often as possible, no need for beautiful commit messages, you can write the commit message which is good for you.
3. Do not commit node_modules, npm.error.logs and yarn.error files
4. Update the readme.md with the following [template](https://github.com/aksharnow/assignment-instructions/blob/master/readme-template.md).
5. When you receive a new assignment create a folder in the repo and put all the files related to that assignment in the same folder
6. Remove all the packages that are not related to the project from package.json
7. Always have latest version packages in the package.json - No exceptions on this please
8. Add a shot video of the all the functionalities of the application
